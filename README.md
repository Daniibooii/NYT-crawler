# Project Description
This project allows the user to pull, or "scrape," articles from the New York Times.<br>

This is my fork of a group project developed over an afternoon by a four person team.<br>
The work was divided into two main portions, roughly corresponding to front-end and back-end work.<br>

It is my intention to return to and further develop this project soon, utilizing newly-acquired skills.<br>

# How to Use
Access the scraper directly at: https://daniibooii.github.io/NYT-scraper/<br>
or DL my repo and open index.html in the browser of your choice.<br>

The user will enter their search terms into a form, and our scraper will find relevant articles from the New York Times.<br>
These will be saved and printed out at the bottom of the page, for the user to access.<br>
