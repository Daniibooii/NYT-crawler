# NYT-crawler

# Project Description
This project is intended to allow the user to pull or "scrape" articles from the New York Times for later reading.<br>

This is my fork of a group project worked on over 3-4 hours.<br>
A four person team worked to complete the tasks listed after this introduction.<br>
The work was divided into two main portions, roughly corresponding to front-end and back-end work.<br>
Two team members were assigned to each.<br>

My version of the completed project is hosted at: https://daniibooii.github.io/nyt-crawler/<br>

# Notes
<br>

# Remaining Work
Some amount of JS/JQ work remains; I would also like to polish up my CSS/Bootstrap, time permitting.
