# NYT-crawler

# Project Description
This project is intended to allow the user to pull or "scrape" articles from the New York Times for later reading.<br>

This is my fork of a group project developed over an afternoon by a four person team.<br>
The work was divided into two main portions, roughly corresponding to front-end and back-end work.<br>
Two team members were assigned to each.<br>

# How to Use
Access the scraper directly at: https://daniibooii.github.io/NYT-crawler/<br>
or DL my repo and open index.html in the browser of your choice.<br>

The user will enter their search terms, and our scraper will find relevant articles from the New York Times.<br>
These will be saved and printed out at the bottom of the page, for the user to access.<br>

The original project notes may be found immediately below.<br>

## Remaining Work
Some amount of JS/JQ work remains; I would also like to polish up my CSS/Bootstrap, time permitting.
